 ## :page_with_curl: Description
  
The purpose of this project is to put into practice the theory of deterioration proposed by the German psychologist who was a pioneer in the development of experimental methods for measuring mechanical learning and memory. In this way, this application allows the user to do what Ebbinghaus proposed, that is, make 4 revisions (one right after, another one day after, one week after and one month after).
